Hi, it’s Yi here! 🙌

I’m a PhD candidate at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. From undergraduate to postgraduate studies, all my degrees have been in education—so I’ve been in this field for ten years, and I’m committed to making it my lifelong career.

I’ve always loved working with children, which is why I chose primary education as my undergraduate major. However, as I continued on the path of educational research, I realized that teachers’ emotions and well-being are often overlooked in schools. This made me wonder: how can unhappy teachers nurture happy students? While we constantly emphasize the importance of students’ social-emotional learning (SEL), do teachers themselves have enough social-emotional competence to support this kind of education? These questions led me to my PhD research topic: teachers’ stress, emotion regulation, and well-being. Through my research, I hope to better understand the emotional challenges teachers face in school settings and offer suggestions for creating a healthier work environment.

I am primarily a quantitative education researcher, using surveys to explore the antecedents and outcomes of teacher well-being. I also focus on enhancing teachers’ psychological well-being through educational interventions. But that doesn’t mean my research is just “data-driven” or cold and impersonal. I believe that in educational research, behind every number is a person, and behind every analysis is a theory. My goal is to conduct research that is both meaningful and insightful, and this will always be my pursuit.🦾

Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I look forward to meeting more like-minded friends as we journey together towards better education!🥰
