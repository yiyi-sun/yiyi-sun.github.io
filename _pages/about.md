Hi, it’s Yi here! 🙌

I’m a PhD candidate at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. From undergraduate to postgraduate studies, all my degrees have been in education—I’ve been in this field for ten years, and I’m committed to making it my lifelong career.

I’ve always loved working with children, which is why I chose primary education as my undergraduate major. However, as I continued on the path of educational research, I realized that teachers’ emotions and well-being are often overlooked in schools. This made me wonder: how can unhappy teachers nurture happy students? While we constantly emphasize the importance of students’ social-emotional learning (SEL), do teachers themselves have enough social-emotional competence to support this kind of education? These questions led me to my PhD research topic: teachers’ stress, emotion regulation, and well-being. Through my research, I hope to better understand the emotional challenges teachers face in school settings and offer suggestions for creating a healthier work environment.

I prefer quantitative research methods, using questionnaire surveys to explore the antecedents and outcomes of teacher well-being. But that doesn’t mean my research is just “data-driven” or cold and impersonal. I believe that in educational research, every number represents a real person, and every analysis is rooted in a meaningful theory. My goal is always to do research that’s both meaningful and insightful—and that’s what I’ll keep striving for! 🦾🥰


# 🌻 Research Interests
My research interests are centered on <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#469035;">emotion regulation</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#469035;">well-being</span>, and <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#469035;">social-emotional learning</span> within school settings. I also focus on enhancing teachers’ and students’ social-emotional competence and psychological well-being through <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#469035;">educational interventions</span>.

**Key Research Questions**:
- What factors inﬂuence teachers’ and students’ emotion regulation and well-being?
- How does emotion regulation function in the daily lives of teachers and students?
- What factors facilitate or hinder teachers’ and students’ social-emotional learning?
- What educational interventions can be designed to improve teachers’ and students’ social-emotional competence and their well-being?

**Keywords**: 
- Teacher emotion, emotion regulation, well-being, social-emotional learning
