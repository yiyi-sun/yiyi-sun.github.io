<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Research Fellow at the National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I obtained my Ph.D. in Education from The Chinese University of Hong Kong. My research focuses on emotion regulation, well-being, and social-emotional learning in school settings. I also focus on enhancing teachers’ and students’ social-emotional competence and psychological well-being through educational interventions.

My current research interests center on adolescents’ peer networks and their relationships with academic, motivational, social, and emotional outcomes. Methodologically, I primarily conduct quantitative research using a range of advanced analytical approaches. My work has been published in international peer-reviewed journals, including *Teaching and Teacher Education*, *Social Psychology of Education*, and *International Journal of Educational Research*.



# 🌻 Research Interests
My research focuses on broader well-being topics within school settings and follows two main lines of inquiry: <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#469035;">teacher emotion</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#469035;">adolescent social networks</span>. I examine how teachers’ and students’ social-emotional experiences unfold over time and how these processes relate to academic, motivational, social, and emotional outcomes. I also aim to inform <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#469035;">educational interventions</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#469035;">professional development</span> that strengthen social-emotional competence and well-being.

**Key Research Questions**:
* What factors are associated with teachers’ emotion regulation and professional well-being?
* How does emotion regulation function in teachers’ day-to-day professional lives?
* How do adolescents’ peer relationships and social networks evolve over time, and what contextual factors shape these dynamics?
* How are peer network attributes associated with students’ academic, motivational, social, and emotional outcomes?
* What educational interventions and professional development approaches can support teachers’ and students’ social-emotional competence and well-being?

**Keywords**:
* Well-being, teacher emotion, emotion regulation, social-emotional learning, social networks, peer relations, professional development, adolescents, longitudinal study
