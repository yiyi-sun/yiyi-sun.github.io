<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Research Fellow at the National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I obtained my Ph.D. in Education from The Chinese University of Hong Kong. My research focuses on emotion regulation, well-being, and social-emotional learning in school settings. I also focus on enhancing teachers’ and students’ social-emotional competence and psychological well-being through educational interventions.

My current research interests center on adolescents’ peer networks and their relationships with academic, motivational, social, and emotional outcomes. Methodologically, I primarily conduct quantitative research using a range of advanced analytical approaches. My work has been published in international peer-reviewed journals, including *Teaching and Teacher Education*, *Social Psychology of Education*, and *International Journal of Educational Research*.
